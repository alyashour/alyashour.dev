        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Aly Ashour, and I'm an engineer. <br>
            I live to work with computers and technology and odds are if it's metal or silicon I want my hands on it.
            <br>
            <!-- make this href point to WEAP & business -->
            I write lots of code and chew on cables and keyboards both on my own and on any team that'll let me in
            (<a href="">and even some that don't</a>).
        </p>

        <h3>Passions</h3>
        <p>
                I love learning. In any flavour. Classes, courses, videos, books. In a perfect world I'd finish my degree
            and run right back in for another again and again until I'd tried everything. I want to know how everything works, 
            all the way down.
            I'm also an occasional teacher. I've tutored math and physics for 5 years and give lectures on computer science for
            students through my club at Western.
        </p>
        <p>
            Besides that I adore space, physics, and ancient history, I play chess, some video games, football (not the american one), 
            and if I had one wish I'd give everyone the chance to look through a telescope.
        </p>

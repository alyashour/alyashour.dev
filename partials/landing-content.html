<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
    My name is <b>Aly Ashour</b>, and I'm a software engineering student at the University of Western Ontario.
</p>
<p>
    I live to work with computers and technology and odds are if it's metal or silicon I want my hands on it.
    I write lots of code and chew on cables and keyboards both on my own and on any team that'll let me in
    (<a href="pages/founder.html">and even some that don't</a>).
</p>

<h3>Passions</h3>

<p>
    I'm passionate about building systems that solve real-world problems — the kind that exist outside of the computer
    or the classroom.
    I'm especially drawn to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Autonomy</b> — not just "self-driving" as a concept, but how we can teach machines to think and the problems
        they can solve.</li>
    <li><b>Applied Engineering</b> — systems that help people, improve lives, or change the world for the better. I want
        to
        build tools that matter.</li>
    <li><b>Global solutions</b> — especially for public systems like transit, safety, or accessibility.
        We have a responsibility to create for the whole world.
    </li>
    <li><b>Difficult problems</b> — I'm fascinated by ambiguity and drawn to difficulty. An "unsolved" problem is just a
        signal saying there is more to see here. I hope to push the technical boundary further than we thought possible.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Besides that I adore space, physics, and ancient history, I play chess, some video games, football
    (not the american one), and my favourite song is Fragile by Laufey.

            Autopilot (or AP for short) is my club at the
            <b>University of Western Ontario</b>.
            <br />
            I and 3 close friends started it in 2024 to serve other Software and
            Computer engineering students.

                    Since that point the club has grown considerably to over 100
                    members. We've hosted multiple <b>competitions</b>,
                    contributed <b>thousands of lines of open-source code</b>,
                    and we've even been able to host workshops to
                    <b>teach students AI and machine learning</b>.
